<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
To create a simple base converter between the binary, decimal, hexadecimal and octal bases. The most common and used ones. 
</p>
<h2>Expected Output</h2>
<p>
The expected results are three conversions to the base to which the number to be converted corresponds.<div>
At the same time, a "invalid base" message will pop-up every time a base not included is entered and the option to try to enter a new number will be displayed.<div>
The binaries can only be composed of ones and zeroes, the hexadecimals of the numbers 0-9 and the letters AF (representing the numbers 10-15),
the octals can only be composed of numbers 0-7 and the decimals can only have numbers from 0-9.<div>
</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
An iteration through each character of the input string to validate if the number is appropriate to the base<div>
and a convertion from string to integer to make the calculations, using decimals to make the process between bases much easier.<div>
